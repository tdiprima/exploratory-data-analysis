[*I Built an AI That Thinks Like a Data Analyst â€” Then It Went Viral. So I Made It Smarter.*](https://medium.com/data-science-collective/i-built-an-ai-that-thinks-like-a-data-analyst-then-it-went-viral-so-i-made-it-smarter-1f3206a8254b) by Mukundan Sankar

- **Things To Try Myself, based on the article:**
   - Create a Python script that automates basic EDA tasks on a CSV file, like generating descriptive statistics and visualizations: `visit_occurrence_eda.py`
   - Develop a small web app using Flask that allows users to upload a CSV file and receive a summary report: `flask-demo` and `streamlit-demo`
   - Implement a command-line tool in Python that provides insights from a dataset with minimal input from the user: `autoinsight.py`
